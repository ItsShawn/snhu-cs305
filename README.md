### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial aimed to enhance the security of its software systems. The task was to identify and rectify software security vulnerabilities to prevent data breaches and ensure safe and secure communication. The focus was on revamping an SSL Server application, particularly emphasizing secure communications through cryptographic techniques and enhanced protocols like HTTPS.

### What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
The project successfully identified and rectified vulnerabilities within Artemis Financial's software systems, highlighting the importance of coding securely. By implementing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and transitioning to HTTPS, secure transmission of data and overall data integrity were ensured. This underscored the crucial role of software security in protecting sensitive information, preventing unauthorized access, and maintaining the company’s reputation.

### Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The vulnerability assessment proved challenging yet informative, particularly in implementing SHA-256 for checksum verification and using the OWASP Dependency-Check for static analysis. These tools helped detect potential security issues and reinforced the application’s defenses, proving crucial in understanding the importance of thorough security measures.

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Increased layers of security were achieved by integrating AES encryption, utilizing HTTPS, and conducting rigorous testing. For future projects, utilizing tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and other industry-standard security practices will be crucial in assessing vulnerabilities and deciding on mitigation techniques.

### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code and software application were both functional and secure, secondary and functional testing were conducted, including refactoring and static analysis. After each change, the application was reassessed to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced, ensuring the application's robustness against potential security threats. 

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Several valuable resources and tools were utilized, such as AES, SHA-256, and HTTPS protocols, alongside the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin. These practices provide a framework for secure coding and vulnerability assessment that are instrumental for any future tasks in software security.

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
This assignment can demonstrate to future employers the practical experience in implementing secure software practices, problem-solving in security vulnerability contexts, and the ability to enhance software security and functionality. Detailed documentation of the approach and the results of vulnerability assessments would serve as excellent proof of capabilities.
